# Ranger

A small Javascript utility to grab, wrap and serialize ranges of text nodes.

The goal of this library is to be a small and resilient tool that gets one thing done well.

It does not have any dependency besides `wgxpath` if parsing serialized (XPath) ranges in IE is required, in which case it must be `install()`ed before using Ranger.

## Support

It works in modern browsers.

Tested on latest Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, Safari, IE 9/10/11, Opera for Windows 8, Android stock browser, Chrome for Android, Chrome for iPhone, iPad mobile Safari.

## Documentation

For now, look at the tests.
